# Known bugs

These are all the bugs I've found and haven't fixed yet.

- Sometimes dropping your blob in a room won't register and you will be placed in the 'global room'
  - Most likely caused by overlapping requests.
- Cannot go back to default room due to it causing errors with drag and drop, currently havent found a fix
